## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a React SPA that matched a provided design and utilised an API with GET and POST requests.

## Design Approach

- A responsive site was created using conventional breakpoints to ensure a smooth experience on a variety of screen sizes.

- Utils files containing pure, reusable functions were used to keep the code DRY.

- SCSS variables and mixins were used to increase the speed at which code could be written without compromising quality. This also maintained consistent styling across the site and enabled fast modification of generic properties globally.

- React Hooks were used to manage state.

- React Router Dom was used to route between pages.

- SEO was optimised by following good practise within the HTML document.

- Create React App was used to bundle and minify the app.

- ESLint was used to ensure clean code was written and any unused code was noticed and removed.
